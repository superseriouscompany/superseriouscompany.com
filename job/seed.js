            Today, the big tuna and the little tuna woke up in Portugal (I'm the big tuna).
            This here's a holy place: the only country on the planet to provide low living costs, fast internet speeds, AND epic surf.
            Here, we plan on building a business that will finally make us rich and famous – behold Super Serious Company.
            We thought it wise to start by writing down our ten-, five-, and one-year goals.

            We did long term goal setting and Santi and I are aligned in our visions of grandiose and eccentric lives, except my 10 year goal list has “Kids” and his 5 year goal list has “No Kids.”

            Our weekly food budget is 60 euros each. I spent 46 euros today and I ate more than half my food already and I am panicking.

            While I was making dinner, Santi inexplicably put his fuck playlist on the big jambox.

            Neil's sad, because we're pretty much fucked.
            I'm playing the forward-looking, hopeful, we-can-do-this role, but when he's not looking, I sneak these little existential-angst looks out the window – Mazzy Star playing in the headphones, etc.
            Just gonna ignore the daunt and focus on the micro projects. Signing off, the big tuna.

            Despite getting two promising leads on AWS credits for the business, I felt ineffective today. It might be because:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>our work life balance is tilting towards life and I wrote my first line of code at 9:30pm.</li>
            <li>my body is wondering what happened to the surplus of pizza and cocktail calories it was trained to rely on in NYC.</li>
            <li>when you work on your own shit, it’s harder to finish fast by ignoring better ways to do things.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Regardless, I’m gonna wake up tomorrow and start working and not stop til I feel effective again. Also Santi’s website design looks dope.
